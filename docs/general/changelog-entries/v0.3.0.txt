Added
=====

- Added coverage reports for the unit tests of the waf-tools.
- Added general safety information.
- Added a rudimentary hardware change process to the hardware developer manual.
- Added information on the criticality of used tools.
- Added the calculation of pack values (current, power, high voltage) to the
  redundancy module.
- Added a manual on using debugger by Segger or Lauterbach in conjunction with
  the platform.
- Added a problem matcher to the ``build_docs`` task in Visual Studio Code
  so that the IDE can parse warnings printed from Doxygen
- Added documentation stubs for all embedded software modules
- Added interface description for CAN communication (.dbc and .sym)

Changed
=======

- SBC no longer monitors input on FCCU pins as usage of these pins is currently
  not supported
- The MIC modules are now able to define their own threshold values for
  plausible cell voltage measurements. In order to implement this, the MIC
  has to declare a struct of type ``MIC_PLAUSIBILITY_VALUES_s`` and pass it to
  the plausibility-functions of the MIC.
- Improves deployment speed with the internal deployment script.
- Simplifies the macro that records the program counter in ``fassert.h`` with
  input from static analysis.
- Disables the static analysis finding for dead branches in the expansion of
  the ``FAS_ASSERT`` assertion macro as the assertion should not be hit by
  normal operating code.
- Clarified the internal merge request template.
- Asserts that the SPI function ``SPI_TransmitReceiveDataDma()`` does not
  receive null pointer as parameter.
- Improved minor code quality issues in the ``DIAG_Initialize()`` function.
- Improved the documentation on installing dependencies.
- Removed function ``DIAG_configAssert()`` as it is replaced by ``FAS_ASSERT``.
- The diagnosis module has been restructured. The callbacks for each type of
  diagnosis event are now implemented in type specific files, e.g., for the
  current sensor in ``diag_cbs_current-sensor.c``. These files are in
  ``src/app/engine/diag/cbs/``. Unit tests have been added.
- Fixed typos related to battery cell and battery system.
- Enhanced the documentation section on the build process.
- Improved the documentation of the temperature sensor interface (TSI).
- Some structs in the database did not conform to the naming conventions.
- Renamed the hardware directory from ``hw`` to ``hardware``.
- ``clang-format``, ``black`` and ``pylint`` tools have been moved into the
  guidelines tool. Configuration is now done via ``rules.json`` as all other
  guidelines.

Deprecated

Removed
=======

Fixed
=====

- Corrected the function ``LTC_I2CCheckACK()`` that did not check the
  acknowledge signal of multiplexer over I2C communication.
- Corrected the function ``LTC_SetMUXChCommand()`` because message content for
  I2C communication with multiplexers was wrong.
- Corrected several instances in the ``LTC6813-1``-driver where the
  loop-counter variable has been declared outside of the loop.
- Renamed function names in ``redundancy`` module to adhere to style guide
  rules.
- Fixed wording and replaced *isolation* by *insulation*.
- Replaced references to LG INR18650MJ1 by generic battery cell configuration.
- Tasks were not initialized correctly. The IDLE task never run.
