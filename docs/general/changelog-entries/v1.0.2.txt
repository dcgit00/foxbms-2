Added
=====

- Added number of valid cell voltages and temperatures used for calculating
  minimum, maximum and average values to database entry
  ``DATA_BLOCK_ID_MIN_MAX``.
- Added the build option ``--skip-doxygen`` to enable faster documentation
  builds, if an API documentation is not required/does not need to be updated.

Changed
=======

- Do no longer hard code the EOL for the files in the VS Code settings, instead
  just use the system EOL instead.

Removed

Fixed
=====

- Fixed typo in changelog. The LTC 6804-1 is basically an older version of the
  LTC 6811-1 (previously it stated wrongly LTC 6812-1).
- ``linkcheck`` and ``spelling`` were not run when the documentation was built.
- The GUI searched for the wrong license file during startup routine and
  therefore failed to start successfully.
- Improved the readability of the engine block schematic in the general
  software documentation.
- Fixed an issue where the ``waf.sh``-wrapper would not print the error message
  when the conda environment could not be found.
- Removed unused variables in build scripts.
- Fixed readmes in the tools directory and its subdirectories.
