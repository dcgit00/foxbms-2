Added
=====

- A basic block diagram and description of a battery system and the voltages.
  and the currents that need to be measured have been included in the
  documentation.
- Add helper script to run the library test build
  (``tests/variants/lib-build/lib-build.bat``).
- Updated the Axivion configuration to use version ``7.2.3``.
- Added minimal documentation for Axivion setup.
- Improved the Axivion configuration:

  - use ``FAS_ASSERT`` as assert macro in order to be compliant with the style
    guide
  - fix some includes (library-inclusions and unnecessary inclusions)
  - adds the Axivion example for race condition analysis and a minimal
    configuration of entry points
  - updates ``.axivion.preinc`` with missing symbols
  - makes cafeCC point to the right compiler library
  - excludes vendored code from analysis
  - disables all naming conventions (as they are currently not configured and
    thus horribly noisy)
  - disables the NoImplicitTypeConversion check as it is very noisy and better
    done with appropriate MISRA rules
  - detect unsafe variable access by defining task priorities
  - make Axivion less noisy, by disabling unused style-checks.
  - Made rules for loop-counter variables more strict.
  - enabling more detailed computation of findings (Abstract Interpretation in
    Static Semantic Analysis).

Changed
=======

- Improved the code quality of the module ``foxmath`` so that it is
  MISRA-compliant (:numref:`FOXMATH`).
- Refactored ``cc-options`` parsing to separate tool to simplify the TI ARM CGT
  compiler tool.

Deprecated
==========

Removed
=======

Fixed
=====

- When HALCoGen was not available, the Waf tool nevertheless tried to set the
  respective include path, which lead to exception in Python. This has been
  fixed by not trying to set the include path when HALCoGen is not available.
