Minor release of foxBMS 2 (v1.8.0)

* This version of foxBMS bundles with new hardware releases, most importantly
  a new BMS-Master. The BMS-Master version is bumped to ``v1.2.2``.
  For details on the BMS-Master see the changelog and the documentation.
* The BMS-Master now comes with a streamlined supply concept, which only
  requires a single SBC and therefby making the hard- and software simpler.
  Detail on the SBC configuration, which must be flashed on the SBC prior to
  PCB assembly, are also found in the documentation.
  Now the CAN1 Enable and Standby signals have been wired directly to the MCU,
  instead of using I2C based port expander.
  To achieve software compatibility with older BMS-Master releases see
  the documentation.
Further, new releases for all |bms-slaves| have been added.
* Updated the Python environment (``2025-01-pale-fox``).
  See the documentation on how to install the update locally.
* This commit introduces changes that are required for the bootloader.
  **The actual bootloader is not included in this commit.**
* Changed the behavior of the ``BMS`` state machine.
  After startup, the reception of ``STANDBY`` request (CAN message
  ``f_BmsStateRequest``) is now necessary to enter BMS ``STANDBY``.
* Improved the consistency of the CAN driver implementation.
* Invalid flags in the CAN messages ``f_CellVoltages`` and
  ``f_CellTemperatures`` were transmitted inverted.
* Balancing information is now transmitted via CAN.
* The CAN1 enable and standby pins where moved from port expander 2 to discrete
  GPIOs.
* A dedicated CAN message for the transmission of fatal errors was added.
  Diagnosis  entries with a severity of ``DIAG_FATAL_ERROR`` lead to an opening
  of the contactors. This CAN message will be transmitted with a period of
  100ms as soon as an active fatal error has been detected, until the error is
  cleared again.
* The build commands have been streamlined.
  Consult the documentation for details.
* Upgraded FreeRTOS to V10.4.6.
* Improved unit test coverage.
* Improved various sections of the documentation.
* Fixed various bugs in ADES1830 AFE driver:
  * Invalid flags for cell temperatures were not set correctly.
  * Invalid flags for GPIO measurement values were not set correctly.
  * Diagnosis entry for ``DIAG_ID_AFE_COMMUNICATION_INTEGRITY`` was not called.
  * String and module voltage was previously not measured/calculated.
