``fox.py``
==========

.. note::

   Actually ``fox.py`` is just the name of the wrapper script that is in the
   root of the repository and the name of the package is just ``cli``.
   But for readability - and it sounds better - the documentation uses
   ``fox.py`` when actually the ``cli`` is meant.

In the following the automatically generated documentation of the source three
of ``cli`` is shown.
