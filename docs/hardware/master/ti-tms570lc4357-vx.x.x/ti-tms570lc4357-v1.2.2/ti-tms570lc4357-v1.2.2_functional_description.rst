Master TMS570 ``v1.2.2`` Functional description
===============================================

.. important::

   The MC33FS830A0ES needs to be programmed before the PCB is assembled.
   For more information, see below.

Supply concept
##############

A MC33FS8530A0ES programmable automotive, functionally safe multi-output
power supply IC from NXP is used to ensure a safe operation of the hardware.
This chip needs to be OTP-programmed with the specific correct setting, so that
it can supply the MCU and the peripherals etc. with the correct voltage as
designed (see the Altium files for that).
The details on **how to program** these voltages in the MC33FS830A0ES cannot be
shared due to NDAs. Please get in contact with the manufacturer to get this
information.
However, the **OTP file for programming** can be provided.

You can find the OTP file
`here <https://iisb-foxbms.iisb.fraunhofer.de/foxbms/gen2/hardware/release/>`__.
The OTP file is provided in the |bms-master| hardware release.
Additionally, it can be downloaded directly.

.. note::

   Please ensure to read and understand the information in NOTICE.txt which is
   included in the .zip file.
