# Installation Instructions for the Host Machine

This document serves as a short summary on how to setup the **host machine**
for development of foxBMS 2.

For more detailed installation instructions (that include more automation and
less user interaction during the installation) for the host machine see
[docs/getting-started/software-installation.rst](./docs/getting-started/software-installation.rst).

> **_NOTE 1:_**
>
> Read the documentation carefully and follow every point exactly as described.\
> Otherwise, the configuration workload in later points of the setup or the
> development will be significantly higher.
>
> **_NOTE 2:_**
>
> These are the installation instructions for the host machine.\
> These are **NOT** the instructions for installing (i.e., flashing) the created
> binary on the target.\
> Flashing the binary requires a hardware debugger/flashing tool.

## Environment Updates

Sometimes it might be required to update the build environment.
It that is the case, it is then mentioned in the
[CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

To update the build environment the following steps must be done:

   > **_NOTE:_** The placeholder ``<name-of-the-new-env>`` must be replaced
                 with the actual name of the new build environment, which is
                 then documented in the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

1. Create a virtual environment ``<name-of-the-new-env>`` by running in `cmd.exe` or
   `PowerShell`.
   - `cmd.exe`:

      ```cmd
      py -m venv %USERPROFILE%\foxbms-envs\<name-of-the-new-env>
      ```

   - `PowerShell`:

     ```pwsh
     py -m venv $env:USERPROFILE\foxbms-envs\<name-of-the-new-env>
     ```

1. Activate the virtual environment by running in `cmd.exe` or ``PowerShell`.
   - `cmd.exe`:

      ```cmd
      %USERPROFILE%\foxbms-envs\<name-of-the-new-env>\Scripts\activate.bat
      ```

   - `PowerShell`:

     ```pwsh
     &"$env:USERPROFILE\foxbms-envs\<name-of-the-new-env>\Scripts\activate.ps1"
     ```

1. Install the required packages by running:

   ```pwsh
   cd path\to\foxbms-2 # cd into the root of the repository
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt --no-deps
   ```
